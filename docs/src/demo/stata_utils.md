# Stata-like utilities

So far I have tried to implement
1. tabulate
2. xtile
3. winsorize

Other stata-like panel stuff are
panel_fill

Other packages that do similar things

  - See [statar](https://github.com/matthieugomez/statar) for a good package that implements stata feature into R.
  - See [Binscatters.jl](https://github.com/matthieugomez/Binscatters.jl)
  - [Douglass](https://github.com/jmboehm/Douglass.jl) to work with DataFrames in Julia using a stata-like syntax.
